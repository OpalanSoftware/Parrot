Welcome to Parrot Engine! It is an Open Source graphics renderer currently under development, hopefully becoming a full blown game engine at some pont in the near future. Its being build with C++, and is the targeted language for actually using the engine. We might build a simple Visual Scripting language like Unreal Engine uses, but for now, you can access it though the Sandbox project. There are some simple functions already implemented for you to try out. This will be a long term project. I wont be working on it very often, but it will improve. I also wont be accepting errors or updates. I am open to contributers and ideas, but dont excpect then to be implemented any time soon. 

I am setting up a website, so that'll be up soon.
